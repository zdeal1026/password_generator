# Purpose
The purpose of this exercise is to create a working javascript file to make a password generator work. The html and css file did not need any alteration.


# Criteria
1. When generate is clicked, the user is presented with a series of prompts to include:
    -How many characters (between 8-128)?
    -Do you want numbers?
    -Do you want upper case letters?
    -Do you want lower case letters?
    -Do you want special characters?

2. When prompts are answered at least one character type should be present for each selected.

3. When password is generated it should match the selected prompts.

4. The password is then displayed


# Notes
This task was extrememly difficult. I was unable to get the password to generate. The prompts kept looping and I couldn't figure out how to fix it. 

# Credits
Matierial and ideas borrowed from Trilogy Education services along with teachings from Anthony Cooper and Sasha Peterson. Youtube videos on password generators also utilized.
